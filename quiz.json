    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The newborn skull has six fontanelles: one anterior and one posterior, plus a pair  \nof anterolateral (sphenoidal) and a pair of posterolateral (mastoid) fontanelles. Only option B \nstates the correct number. Options A and C under- or over-estimate the number, while option D \nrefers only to the major fontanelles."

    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The anterior fontanelle is shaped like a diamond or rhomboid and lies between \nthe frontal and parietal bones. The posterior fontanelle is triangular, so option A is incorrect. \nCircular or pentagonal fontanelles are not recognised anatomical descriptions."

    "answerKey": "C",
    "correctIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The anterior fontanelle remains open to allow brain growth and usually closes \nbetween one and two years after birth. The posterior fontanelle closes much earlier (around \ntwo months), so option B reflects the closure of the posterior fontanelle. Closure at birth (option  \nA) or as late as ten years (option D) does not occur in normal development."

    "answerKey": "B",
    "correctIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "The anterior fontanelle can serve as a window into intracranial pressure and \nhydration status. A depressed fontanelle indicates reduced intracranial pressure due to severe \ndehydration, whereas a bulging fontanelle is seen in hydrocephalus or raised intracranial \npressure (options A and C).
